# phone-services-twilio
This is a simple app (example and incomplete) using Twilio API for click-to-call, web phone, send message and lead alert!

I started this as a Corvisa (now Shoretel) project but found that their API was so rigid and less adaptive. Then I found about Twilio and started exploring into it. Their API is awesome!

###### Here are some of the examples:
#### 1. Login Screen

#### 2. Click-to-Call (I believe this would be a great CRM feature!)

#### 3. Web Phone (another great CRM feature if implemented)
